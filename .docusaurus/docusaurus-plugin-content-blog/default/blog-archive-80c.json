      "content": "Hello everyone! It has been a long time, and you are all overdue for an update about the current state of DeviantCord, which quite\nfrankly has been having a lot of issues with consistency and deviations being missed. In this post I will be explaining\nthe current status of the project, the issues we experienced during DeviantCord 4's development and how we are planning\non handling things moving forward to prevent this period of stagnation after the release of DeviantCord 4. \n\nI will also mention, that for users of DeviantCord 3. Today I have released a fix for DeviantCord 3 to fix an issue\nthat was affecting a lot of users, primarily group deviation folders.\nThis fix was very easy to fix once I was made aware of it. You should see a significant backlog of deviations being posted\nto your servers posted last night.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## What happened? Why is it taking so long?\nAgain, I want to apologize for the lack of progress on DeviantCord 4. \nDeviantCord 4 initially was supposed to release back in late 2021/Early 2022. However after our primary library (Discord.py)\nhad ceased development (at the time the maintainer said they were done, but has gone back on this about \nhalf a year or more later. I don't remember the exact time). I had to make \nthe difficult decision to rewrite DeviantCord in another library / programming language. \n\nWe would eventually settle on Javacord, but would have to rewrite all functionality of the bot, and the new features\nfor DeviantCord 4 in Java. Then eventually slash commands were introduced and we had to re-design DeviantCord around it\nto not only make it usable, but easy for new users to pick up. Not all artists are computer wizards or know how to use \ncommand line interfaces with parameters/arguments. \n\nDeviantCord 4 also had significant breaking backend design changes on how we store, and send data. All of these changes\nwere made either for reliability reasons, or in order to deliver features that were better then in DeviantCord 3.\nThe most visable change is that when our deviation update system detects a post by an artist, our new notification system\nwill tell the bot to send a notification without the bot having to check for changes in the queue. It will effectively \nknow if there are new messages to send instead of checking the queue for changes on a schedule. \n\nWorking through these setbacks was not only time consuming, but led to burn out. I currently also work full time, and\nin July 2022 I started a new position as an Engineer at Platform.sh, and after half a year I had the opportunity to\nwork with many of the other times in a much more personal capacity. I attended 3 conferences that required significant\ntravel in April, and May of this year as my time off as well to get more acquainted with the Python community.\n\nIt wasn't until my vacation this October that I managed to feel motivated to started making significant progress again. \n\nReworking all of these features, and implementing the needed backend changes caused the scope of the V4 to keep expanding.\nEven if it couldn't be helped. I kept adding more and more to V4.\n\n## What is changing to prevent this from happening in the future?\nMoving forward after the release of DeviantCord 4, we will not be working on significant bot changes, and backend\nchanges at the same time. To prevent the scope of releases from becoming to large for a single person to handle. \nI will also be managing my time better with projects and work in general. \n\nIn the instance where functionality is broken for users, we will be approaching this differently as well. \nIf functionality of the bot\nbreaks, we will work on restoring the functionality. In the case of DeviantCord when slash commands became mandatory, and\nDeviantCord 4 wasn't close to being released, we should have released DeviantCord 3.1 as a way to keep the bot available to \nall users.\n\n## When will DeviantCord 4 release?\nI am pleased to announce that I have been making significant progress on DeviantCord 4 and plan on having it released\nby the end of the month. As soon as a production build of DeviantCord 4 is ready I will immediately make preperations\nto migrate the current bot and post an announcement here and in Discord.\n\n\n## Am I able to track DeviantCord 4's current progress?\nYes! As part of my mission to be more transparent, I have set up a page on here that will be updated with the current\ntodo list for DeviantCord 4.
