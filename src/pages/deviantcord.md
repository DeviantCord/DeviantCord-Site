# Coming Soon!

Thank you artist, but DeviantCord is in another castle preparing for DeviantCord 4.

**We are working hard on having DeviantCord 4 available by the end of the month.** You can find more information in our
blog post [here](https://deviantcord.com/blog/deviantcord4-upcoming-release), as well as the current status of work
remaining on DeviantCord 4 [here](https://deviantcord.com/deviantcord4-status)

Due to restrictions imposed by Discord for big bots, we had to turn off commands for DeviantCord 3.

DeviantCord 3 is still posting notifications for previous users, however you cannot make changes to listeners. 
You can request an update to a listener by asking in the support channel on our Discord server!
