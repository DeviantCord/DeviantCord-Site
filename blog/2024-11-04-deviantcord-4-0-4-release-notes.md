![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-4.0.4-blue)

We're excited to announce the latest beta release of DeviantCord (v4.0.4), featuring significant performance improvements and bug fixes. This update focuses on enhancing connection handling, improving thread management, and resolving several critical issues with our checking systems.
