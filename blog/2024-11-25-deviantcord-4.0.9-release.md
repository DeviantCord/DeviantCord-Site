# DeviantCord Beta V4.0.9 Release & Major Announcements

We're excited to share several important updates for the DeviantCord community today!

**üì£ Now Open Source!**
We're thrilled to announce that DeviantCord's ecosystem is now publicly available on GitHub! You can now access the repositories for:
- DeviantCord (main application)
- DeviantDBS (database system)
- Documentation website

Feel free to explore our codebase, contribute, and help us improve these projects!

**üîÑ V4.0.9 Release**
Our latest beta update focuses on internal improvements, specifically a major code restructuring to enhance maintainability and readability. The main class file has been reorganized, with various functionalities now properly distributed across dedicated files.

**üõ†Ô∏è Technical Updates**
- Major code refactoring for improved maintainability
- Resolution of the persistent TransientSQLConnection bug
- Public Root Cause Analysis (RCA) published today detailing the recent connection issues

**‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary Internal Code Freeze**
As of today, DeviantCord will be entering an internal code freeze period until the New Year. During this time:
- Only critical bugs will be addressed by the core team
- No new features will be implemented by the core team
- Regular core development will resume in January 2025

This temporary pause is necessary as our primary developer, Michael, needs to focus on final exams and college commitments.

**üí° Community Contributions Welcome!**
While our core team is on a code freeze, we enthusiastically welcome external contributions! Feel free to:
- Submit pull requests
- Propose new features
- Help improve documentation
- Fix non-critical bugs

**üêõ Bug Reporting During Freeze**
Please continue to report any issues through:
- GitHub Issues on our newly public repositories
- The #beta-bug-reports channel on DeviantCord Discord

**üìÖ Beta Testing Extension**
Due to the recent technical challenges, we're extending the beta testing period by a few weeks to ensure thorough testing and stability.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support of DeviantCord. We're especially excited to see how the community will engage with our newly open-sourced codebase!

Best regards,
The DeviantCord Team
